Certainly! Here's an example of a README file for the code:

# Python Queue-based Shopping System

This is a Python-based shopping system that utilizes a queue data structure to manage a user's shopping cart. The system allows users to create an account, add products to their cart, view the cart, and make purchases using their account balance.

## Features

- User Account Creation: Users can create an account by providing their name and password. The account details are stored in separate text files for each user.
- Account Authentication: Users can log in to their existing account by providing their name and password.
- Account Balance: Each user has a balance associated with their account, which can be used to make purchases.
- Product Catalog: The system maintains a catalog of products available for purchase, stored in a text file.
- Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart, view the contents of the cart, and make purchases.
- Admin Account: An admin account allows for managing user accounts and accessing system details.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `GreatShope.py`.
2. Follow the prompts to either create a new user account or log in to an existing account.
3. Once logged in, users can:
   - View the product catalog and add items to their cart.
   - View the contents of their cart and the total price.
   - Make a purchase, provided they have sufficient funds.
   - Add money to their account balance.
4. Admin accounts have additional options to delete user accounts and view system details.
